Dotfiles 
========

Contains my dotfiles and vim plugin setup as well as an install script to manage the setup.

## Installation
Using this setup is as simple as cloning the repository and running the installation script:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/KDercksen/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Your old dotfiles will be backed up in the ~/dotfiles.old directory.
